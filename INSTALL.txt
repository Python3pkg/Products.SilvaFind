Installation instructions:
--------------------------

  * Fresh install:

    Put SilvaFind into your Products folder and restart zope.
    When you create a fresh Silva Root, everything will be 
    setup automaticly. You will have a Silva Find instance
    called 'search' in your Site Root.

  * Upgrade:

    Put SilvaFind into your Products folder, restart zope,
    and install Silva Find in Silva Service Extensions.
    (If you have an existing silva find installed, 
    click the refresh button in silva_extensions)
    Now you should be able to add a "Silva Find" object in the
    Silva Edit interface. If not, go to the "properties" tabs, then 
    click on "addables" so that "Silva Find" objects appear in the
    select dropdown box. 
    Now you have a working search. However, some extra css should be
    loaded to style the search results page. 
    Upload the "head_inject" file to your Silva Root. This file
    can be found in the "layout" directory of the Silva product.
    Now edit your "layout_macro.html" file (in the root of your Silva site)
    and add the following line inside the <head> tag:

    <!-- override for specific css/js inclusion in the head -->
    <link tal:replace="structure here/head_inject|nothing"/>
