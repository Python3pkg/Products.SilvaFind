Changes
=======

1.1.10 (2009/02/09)
-------------------

- Don't translate fields names and ids. It's stupid and break
  SilvaFind if the client browser is using something else than english
  as default language.

1.1.9 (2009/02/06)
------------------

- Don't do any search by default. You need to click on the button
  *Search* to have any results.

- Validate edition form: you need at least to have one search
  criterion activated, and one display field. Message feedback have
  been added on that form.

- Remove deprecated use of zope.app.zapi, use zope.component instead.

- ``searchResults`` is deprecated.

1.1.8 (2009/02/04)
------------------

- Fix ported from the trunk so find works after you click on save in
  the edit form.

- Removing nested tables, adding css classes, adding type attribute.

1.1.7 (2008/11/04)
------------------

- Fix metatype selector.

1.1.6 (2008/10/29)
------------------

- Fix tests.

- Redo the render_helper page template for inputs.

1.1.5 (2008/10/02)
------------------

- Reformating the documentation to valid ReST.

1.1.4
-----

Features added:

- SilvaFind does not add a default search instance inside the
  service_find directory anymore. This was only being used by the
  dlcms, which will add it anyway, if it's not there.

1.1.3 (2008/03/03)
------------------

Changes:

- SilvaFind is now using Silva 2.0 zcml extension registration.  From
  this version forward this product will not work in Silva 1.6 or
  lower.

- Changed product to work with Silva 2.1 zcml extension registration.

Bugs Fixed:

- metatypecriterion used all types when no selection was made in SMI,
  it should have used all *available* types instead since this could
  be overwritten with an adapter.

1.1.2
-----

Changes:

- i18n readied for Silva 2.0+.

- Changed product to work with Silva 2.1 zcml extension registration.

1.1.1.2
-------

Changes:

- metatypecriterion allows for list values.

- Some code refactoring in MetatypeCriterionView, so it's easier
  to override.

- Changed the line and border colors in the public view from green to
  gray and removed a green background so it's less likely that the
  SilvaFind colors will conflict with a user's site design.

- Empty searches show nothing instead of everything.

Bugs Fixed:

- Removed hardcoded Silva Document checks in favor of IVersion
  interfaces.

- KeyError for meta_type when doing empty searches.

- SilvaFind search was searching on all "search content" fields, and
  ignoring the checkboxes.

1.1.1
-----

Bugs Fixed:

- Getting path criterion value from request failed because paths in
  the catalog can't have unicode characters.
