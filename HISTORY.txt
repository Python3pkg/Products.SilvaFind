1.1.2

Changes:

    - i18n readied for Silva 2.0+

    - metatypecriterion allows for list values

    - Some code refactoring in MetatypeCriterionView, so it's easier
      to override.

    - Changed the line and border colors in the public view from green
      to gray and removed a green background so it's less likely that
      the SilvaFind colors will conflict with a user's site design.

    - Empty searches show nothing instead of everything.

 Bugs Fixed:

    - Removed hardcoded Silva Document checks in favor of IVersion
      interfaces.

    - KeyError for meta_type when doing empty searches

    - SilvaFind search was searching on all "search content" fields,
      and ignoring the checkboxes

1.1.1

  Bugs Fixed:

    - Getting path criterion value from request failed because paths
      in the catalog can't have unicode characters.
